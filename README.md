In this file, we are providing explanation to the code.

We split the code into sections and give each section a div with an id attribute to reference.

From the start we begin with the code of navigation list
the list will reference the id attributes later stated to work as a bookmark.

Each Day and section will be bookmarked and reference accordingly.

Not much more explanation is required as this is a basic piece of code.
